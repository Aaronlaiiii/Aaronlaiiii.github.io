    <h3 class="one-Q1">
      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h3>
    <h3 class="answer1" >
        The first thing that gets my attention is his layout of the whole page, every part of it makes it like a video games button and futuristic. It also has a power button just like a PC that can turn off and on of his page.
    </h3>

    <h2 class="Q2">Question 2</h2>
    <h3 class="two-Q2">
      Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="answer2">
        First press on the power button: turn off and on the whole page. Second
press on the discord logo: go to the discord page and join their discord server. Third 
press the play button: to a page that has many games in it.

    </h3>

    <h2 class="Q3">Question 3</h2>
    <h3 class="Three-Q3">
      What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h3>
   <h3 class="answer3">
    The most part I was spending time with is the little game that wants you to remember the icon it shows you and press the icon below it after it shows you 5 different icons. For this little game it has five different levels for us to play and you will need to pass each level before you get to the next level, also the number will be bigger based on it level.

    <h2 class="Q4">Question 4</h2>
    <h3 class="Four-Q4">
      What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h3>
    <h3 class="answer4">
        The most common action is go on every little game that they have linked on the page and give those games a try to see if those games are interesting or not. Not only that, I try to click on all the buttons one by one to see which one is linking it to the other and which one is not.
    </h3>

    <h2 class="Q5">Question 5</h2>
    <h3 class="Five-Q5">
      What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h3>
    <h3 class="answer5">
        The main aim of this website is to give people who love gaming to play game without any step sign in or find the game to play. Also letting those gamers play a small game before they try out the main games they have created. 
    </h3>

    <h2 class="Q6">Question 6</h2>
    <h3 class="six-Q6">
      How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </h3>
    <h3 class="answer6">
        The Downstream website's main goal is to let the users play the game straight away, so they do not have to waste the time to find where they can play games. The website is very clear that there is a small on the homepage, a very huge play button on the screen to send users to the page so that it can play the game straight away.

    <h3 class="seven-Q7">
      What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </h3>
    <h3 class="answer7">
        For my impression I think the longer time they use, the more bored they become, also if they play the game many times they will still get bored really fast. However, for me I was getting bored on my third time playing the small game they have on the page, but I only played for around ten minutes.
    </h3>

    <h2 class="Q8">Question 8</h2>
    <h3 class="eight-Q8">
      How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h3>
    <h3 class="answer8">
        After using this website I think this website doesn’t make user to come back very oftenly. The the small game they have does not save your progress, also those small game doesn’t often updated. So if this website keep update the game oftenly and having a function to help user save their progress, it will encourage user to visited over and over again.
